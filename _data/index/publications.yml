Some recent work on proof-reading the Bible text (and Apocryphal books) for Yn Vible Ghaelgagh online https://manx.global.bible/ has brought into focus exactly what this standard consists of. Though in a good number of cases there is variation in spelling, often this variation displays a strong preference. I record below as preferred spellings those which dominate over alternatives in a proportion of 2:1 or more. After that I list most of the words where the alternatives are more evenly matched."

  notes: "‘Homorganic inhibition’ in the Gaelic languages refers to the situation where expected lenition of a word-initial consonant fails when the final consonant of the preceding ‘trigger’ word has the same place of articulation. The cases usually focused on are those where a word-initial coronal obstruent is preceded by a word also ending in a coronal, though we can legitimately ask whether anything similar might be seen when a word-initial velar is preceded by a velar, or a word-initial labial, by a labial. (There is known to have been homorganic inhibition more generally in earlier periods of the Gaelic languages.) We consider the several grammatical contexts in which expected lenition might be inhibited, looking at evidence from our corpus of Classical Manx texts."

The personal pronoun objects of these prepositional nominals are expressed by means of possessive (genitive) constructions, as in my chooyl ‘behind me’, nyn drooid or ny hrooid oc ‘through them’.

  notes: "Manx has a small number —eight— of stative predicates that are constructed with possessive pronouns, as in ta mee my hassoo ‘I am standing’. Most of these items are undoubtedly verbal, that is, they are also constructed as ordinary verbs: cadley ‘sleeping’, lhie ‘lying’, shassoo ‘standing’, soie ‘sitting’, trostey ‘fasting’. However, taaue ‘idle’, and tost ‘silent’ do not have independent verbal uses in Manx, though their cognates in other Gaelic languages have: Sc. G. tàmh v. ‘reside, stay’ (tàmh n. ‘inactivity, idleness’), Ir. tost v. ‘fall silent’ (tost n. ‘silence’). Lomarcan ‘alone’, ‘only’ occurs only in this possessive construction, and, indeed, ny-lomarcan in the sense ‘only’ is better classified as a restrictive focusing modifier than as a predicate. As predicates of ve ‘be’, these eight stative predicate items are constructed in the same way in Classical and Modern Manx: the possessive pronoun agrees in person and number with the subject of ve. My focus here is what other constructions these predicates are found in in Classical Manx, using my corpus of texts 1700-1850 that are digitally searchable. [Revised version of October 2016 paper]"

But the availability of the complete census records for 1901 and 1911, the first two censuses in which a language question was asked (‘Manx, English, or both?’), allows us to see just who spoke Manx (that is, was recorded as being able to do so) in those years.

  notes: "It is well known that initial consonant lenition in Manx is somewhat variable. Acknowledging this might lead one to suppose that variation, or deviation from the rules, is scattered randomly among the consonants subject to lenition, and among the contexts triggering lenition. In a small study, using a corpus that consists of over 1m words of Classical Manx (1700-1850), I show that this is not the case. Some consonants (specifically s- and f-) are markedly more variable than the rest. Leaving those consonants aside, there are contexts in which the ‘correct’ application of lenition is virtually categorical, such as after dy chooilley ‘every’ (which takes Lenition 1: that is, s-, sh- → h-, and all other lenitable consonants affected). In another context, namely in the prepositional phrase ayns y(n)/’sy(n) ‘in the’ (followed by Lenition 2: that is, s- → t-, sh- → çh-, denti-alveolars t-, çh-, d-, j- not affected, other consonants as Lenition 1), deviation from the rule, for consonants other than s- and f-, is rare but not negligible: 1.74% of lenition failure."

- name: "Relative future tense in main clauses in Manx Gaelic"
  author: "Max W. Wheeler"
  pdf: "Relative_future_tense_in_main_clauses_in.pdf"
  notes: "The Manx relative future tense occurs not only in future relative clauses (whence its name), but also in other contexts, such as some adverbial subordinate clauses, e.g. after raad ‘where’, tra ‘when’, my ‘if’, and in certain main clauses, as, for example, Shen-y-raad vees keayney as snaggeraght feeacklyn, ‘There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth’ (Luke 13.28). Of course, positive affirmative future main clauses normally require the independent future tense. The objective of this study is to investigate in what contexts the relative future tense may be used in main clauses in Classical Manx. With that overall focus in mind, I also discuss and illustrate the use of the relative future in subordinate clauses, other than relative clauses themselves, about which I say little. I seek to establish in what contexts the relative future is required, in what contexts it is excluded, and in what contexts its use is variable. The bulk of the exemplification involves the future tense of ve ‘be’; there are 1001 cases of the forms vee’m, veem’s, vees or vees mayd, the relative future paradigms of ve, in the Manx Bible, alongside well over 3000 of the independent and dependent future tense of ve (bee’m, beem’s, bee, bee mayd)."

  notes: "When complex numerals are used with an explicit nominal head (e.g. ‘ninety days’), an issue arises in Manx grammar in the classical period as to where in the numeral expression the noun is placed (never first, though). With numbers up to 60 there is no variation in the construction of numeral expressions. Biblical Manx and Modern Manx are the same in this respect. Above 60, while round hundreds and scores precede the nominal head (and Manx counts in scores up to 180), e.g. kiare-feed co-lhiabbagh ‘fourscore concubines’, shey-feed prince ‘120 princes’, hoght cheead bleïn ‘800 years’, for more complex numerals, there are two patterns of cardinal numeral expressions with a nominal head that can be found in the Manx Bible. Both patterns are common."

  notes: "The Church of England’s Book of Common Prayer with the texts to be spoken translated into Manx Gaelic was published by the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge in London in 1765. The translation was promoted by the Bishop of Sodor and Mann, Mark Hildesley, and undertaken by the Manx clergy, most particularly the Rev. Philip Moore, in conjunction with the Revv. Matthias Curghey and James Wilks, who had revised and completed the translation of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, published by the S.P.C.K. in 1763. From the point of view of linguistic study, the advantage of translation literature is that the intended sense of the texts is clear. For that reason it may be valuable to make available, and searchable, as many texts as possible of the Manx translated literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. In the present edition, the original English text of the parts to be spoken is set alongside the Manx, being taken from The Book of Common Prayer..., printed by Joseph Bentham, Cambridge: University Press, 1765. The text of the Epistle and Gospel passages prescribed in the Prayer Book for reading on each Sunday and Holy day throughout the year is that same as that which was included in the Manx New Testament (1763-67) and later in the complete Bible (1771-75), which also included the Psalms as in the Prayer Book. As the text of the Manx Bible is already available in searchable form, the text of the prescribed Epistle and Gospel passages and of the Psalms is omitted here."

  notes: "Archibald Cregeen’s \"Dictionary of the Manks Language\" is a major work of lexicography that has been used by generations of Manx learners since its publication in 1835. The distinctive way in which the information is presented has meant, however, that some of the dictionary’s potential value is not readily apparent to the user. Both the first edition of the Dictionary (1835) and the second (1910) comprise a strictly alphabetical list of word forms, which is particularly valuable for users not entirely familiar with the nature and range of variation in the initial letter of Manx words, due to initial consonant mutations, and to the addition of consonants (such as g-, d- or n-) before certain forms of vowel-initial verbs. A consequence of this strictly alphabetical procedure, though, is that related forms of the same word, or word-family, are scattered throughout the dictionary. Thus, in a sense, Cregeen’s Dictionary as published is more like an index to a lexicon than a lexicon itself. In this re-ordering of the entries of the Dictionary, lexically related forms are grouped together under a base form or lemma. It thereby becomes possible to consider together the various inflectional forms of each item, its affixal derivatives, and the phrases and compounds containing them. The reordering depends, of course, on correctly identifying the word relationships, and I may have made some erroneous connections, and missed some links that would be appropriate. I hope users will suggest improvements in this respect. In this second edition (December 2015), the text of the citations from the Apocrypha has been included, and some errors have been corrected."

  notes: "The pattern of initial mutation of verbal nouns after er in the perfect tense construction is anomalous, in that some consonants are subject only to Lenition 1, while others may undergo either Lenition 1 or Nasalization. In the Manx Bible including the Apocrypha there are enough examples of the er Perfect construction to get a good perspective on the nature and scope of the variation in question in ‘Classical’ Manx."

- name: "Manx Gaelic inflection, 4. Adjectives"

  notes: "Manx adjectives may inflect for either of the categories comparative and plural, or for both, or for neither. There is no distinct superlative: comparative in Manx covers ‘comparative’ and ‘superlative’. There are two suffixes available for the comparative: -ee and -ey. The comparative suffix -ee occurs almost exclusively with adjectives containing the suffix -agh, which is replaced by -ee in the comparative (e.g. graihagh ‘loving’ - graihee ‘more loving’). Cregeen gives 334 examples of adjectives in -agh that are inflected in this way. The comparative suffix -ey is sometimes accompanied by a change in the stem it is attached to, such as syncope (loss of a medial syllable, as in mennick ‘frequent’ - menkey ‘more frequent’), a change of stem vowel similar to what takes place in some noun genitives before the suffix -ey (e.g. liauyr ‘long’ - lhiurey ‘longer’), or a suppletive stem (e.g. olk ‘bad’ - (s)messey ‘worse’). In Cregeen there are some 117 comparatives in -ey. A dozen adjectives have irregular comparative forms, not involving a suffix, but some other change in the stem (e.g. lhean ‘wide’ - lhea ‘wider’), or a completely different stem (suppletive, e.g. beg ‘small’ - (s)loo ‘smaller’). When no comparative inflection is available for an adjective, the comparative sense comes from the comparative construction itself, which is used in the same way with uninflected and inflected comparatives, as, for example, in (uninflected) t’ee ny s’costal na rubieyn ‘she is more precious than rubies’; (inflected) va ny Nazariteyn eck ny s’glenney na sniaghtey ‘her Nazarites were purer than snow’. The suffix used to make plural adjectives is also -ey. It is added to the basic singular stem (with nearly always no more than orthographic changes). Thus some adjectives that inflect with -ey for both comparative and plural show a changed stem in the comparative, but not in the plural, e.g. çhionn ‘stiff, tight’, comp. çhienney, pl. çhionney. Cregeen gives some 92 plural adjective forms."

- name: "Manx Gaelic inflection, 3. Noun paradigms"

  pdf: "Manx_Gaelic_inflection_3_Noun_paradigms.pdf"
  notes: "In the previous sections (§1-2) I set out what we can learn from Cregeen’s Dictionary about noun plural inflection (§1) and inflected genitive case forms (§2). Here I pursue the matter of the ways in which these two inflections can combine with the basic (nominative singular) stems to form paradigms. Five basic classes of noun paradigms (‘declensions’) can be established, according to the genitive inflection: class A: genitive in -ey, class B: genitive in -ee, class C: genitive in -agh, class D: genitive with stem change, and class E: irregular genitive. The subclasses (A1-9, B1-6, C1-8, and D1-2) correspond to how each genitive inflection interacts with the various types of plural inflection. Though there are 37 different paradigms in all in classes A-D, none of the subclasses other than those just mentioned has more than a dozen members, and many of them have only one member; there are some 17 unique paradigms (outside of class E, all of whose members are unique). It may be of some interest to language typologists that there are so many paradigms given that there are only three grammatical categories involved."

  pdf: "Manx_Gaelic_inflection_2_Genitive_case.pdf"
  notes: "Of the grammatical works on Manx Gaelic, it is A. Cregeen’s A Dictionary of the Manks Language that provides by far the most detail of inflectional morphology. And it was prepared at a time when Manx was a living community language with a large number of native speakers. In this series of studies, I attempt to extract from the dictionary Cregeen’s contribution to a descriptive grammar of ‘Classical Manx’ —the language of written texts of the period 1700-1830. The information on genitive case inflections that follows in this second section is derived from Cregeen’s Dictionary, to which have been added a handful from J. J. Kneen’s Grammar of the Manx Language. The classification of the inflectional patterns is my own. The classification is followed by extensive exemplification of genitive case usage in Cregeen’s dictionary and in the Manx Bible."

- name: "Cregeen’s proverbs and sayings"

  pdf: "Cregeen_Proverbs.pdf"
  notes: "These Manx proverbs and sayings are assembled from Archibald Cregeen, A Dictionary of the Manx Language…, Douglas: Quiggin, etc., 1835. The translations are mostly from the edition revised by J. J. Kneen and others, published in 1910, reprinted by Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh, Ilkley: Moxon Press, 1984. I have revised the capitalization and punctuation, and added cedillas (ç), but otherwise left the 1835 spelling unchanged. Nearly all of Cregeen’s proverbs and sayings are collected, with some others, and translated, in G. W. Wood’s article mentioned in footnote 2 below. The numbers in column 3 below correspond to the numbering in Wood’s article. The symbol ~ means that the form of the proverb or saying in Wood is a little different from that in Cregeen. Where the translations differ, those of Kneen et al. are generally superior, though not always. Where Wood’s translations seem better, I have included them with the initials GWW. A few translations are my own, indicated with MW. "
